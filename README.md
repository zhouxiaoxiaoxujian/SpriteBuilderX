# SpriteBuilderX

    This branch requires the use of https://github.com/newnon/cocos2d-x

After you have created a new project with command line, then replace files completely inside `cocos2d` folder from `newnon/cocos2d-x/cocos`

Core Features:

* Designer-friendly UI
* Animation editor for scenes, characters and boned animations
* Timeless editor
* User interface designer
* Asset management & sprite sheet generation
* Tools for localization
* Publish to iOS & Android platforms
* Custom multi resolution support sysytem
* WYSIWYG editor


## Getting started with the source

Just Build & Run SpriteBuilder/SpriteBuilderX.xcodeproj 


## Still having trouble compiling SpriteBuilderX?

It is most likely still a problem with the submodules(also don't forget to recursively checkout submodules). Edit the .git/config file and remove the lines that are referencing submodules. Then change directory into the top directory and run:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

When building SpriteBuilderX, make sure that "SpriteBuilderX" is the selected target (it may be some of the plug-in targets by default).

## Example of loading the scene and sprites with custom classes
```
bool HelloWorld::init() {

    if ( !Node::init() ) {
        return false;
    }

    CCBX_SIMPLE_MEMBER_VARIABLE(cocosLogoSprite);
    CCBX_SIMPLE_MEMBER_VARIABLE(labelHello);
    CCBX_SIMPLE_MEMBER_VARIABLE(clickedLabel);
    
    CCBX_SIMPLE_SELECTOR_CLICK(click);
    
    //custom loader
    cocos2d::spritebuilder::NodeLoaderLibrary *library = NodeLoaderLibrary::getDefault();
    library->registerNodeLoader("CocosLogo", &CocosLogoSpriteLoader::create);
    
    //simple loader, just examlpe, not been used or created in SBX
    using LevelNodeLoader = SimpleNodeLoader<LevelNode>;
    library->registerNodeLoader("LevelNode", &LevelNodeLoader::create);
    
    CCBXReader *reader = CCBXReader::createFromFile("HelloWorldScene.ccbi");
    cocos2d::Node * scene = reader->createNode(this, SceneScaleType::MINSCALE);
    this->addChild(scene);
    
    _labelHello->setString(StringUtils::format("Hello\nCocos2d-x v%s",_cocosLogoSprite->version.c_str()));
  
    return true;
}
```
