# SpriteBuilderX

SpriteBuilderX is the first game development suite for rapidly building native iOS games with Objective-C and Xcode. SpriteBuilderX is free and open source (MIT licensed) and available on github.

Core Features:

* Designer-friendly UI
* Animation editor for scenes, characters and boned animations
* Tileless editor
* User interface designer
* Asset management & sprite sheet generation
* Tools for localization
* Publish to iOS & Android platforms


## Getting started with the source

 Just Build & Run SpriteBuilder/SpriteBuilder.xcodeproj 


## Still having trouble compiling SpriteBuilderX?

It is most likely still a problem with the submodules(also don't forget to recursively checkout submodules). Edit the .git/config file and remove the lines that are referencing submodules. Then change directory into the top directory and run:

    git submodule update --init

When building SpriteBuilderX, make sure that "SpriteBuilderX" is the selected target (it may be some of the plug-in targets by default).
